# Personal Bio Site (W.I.P.)

---
 #### Description
---
 * ###### Overview
 
    * This is a project I will be working on indefinitely. As I further my understanding of development, I plan on implementing what I learn to this site. It should eventually be a hub to show all of the projects, and work I have done to friends, family, potential employers, and whoever is interested in my work, and development.

* ###### Current Status
    * Right now the site is in it's early rough draft. Most of the information, and media is filler, and the styling is constantly changing. Using this time to experiment, and break things.

* ###### Future Goals/Ideas
    * Fill cards with actual projects I complete.

    * Continue to use JavaScript to easily add/remove data as necessary.

    * Add interactivity
    
    * Add better styling

    * In browser game with another language learned on my own time to show proficiency with learning new code
    
    * Create an actual Bio

* ###### Tasks assigned for homework

    * I created an array of project card objects in JavaScript
    * Created functions to both loop through the array, and print the values of each object directly to the DOM
    * Created a conditional that only prints objects with set value of true.

* ###### Updates
* [3/19 Assignment](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/personal-bio-site-instructions/blob/master/personal-bio-site-02.md)
    * Converted the page into a Single Page Application
    * Added a Navbar
    * Added a Carousel with some pictures of my travels to show on a main page
